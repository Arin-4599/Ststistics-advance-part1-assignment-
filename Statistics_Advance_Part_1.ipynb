        "    - a set of possible from a random experiment like:- tossing of coin etc\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  What are the types of random variables?\n",
        "    - there are two types of random variable i.e descrite random variable , continous random variable\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  What is the difference between discrete and continuous distributions?\n",
        "    - lets take a example to understand this question tossing a coin , throwing a dice is come under descrete distribution and claculate the probilty if a student height is below 100cm is come under continous distribution\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  What are probability distribution functions (PDF)?\n",
        "    - probility distribution function (pdf) come under continous distribution  it is a distribution of continous data and area under curve talks about probility [-1 to 1]\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  How do cumulative distribution functions (CDF) differ from probility       distribution function(pdf)\n",
        "- cumulative distribiution function is summation of all possibility possible upto a given point\n",
        "- probility distribution function has two type of function in it i.e probility density function which is comtinous distribution and other one is probility mass function which is come under discrete distribution and probility distribution has many type of distribution i.e uniform distribution , normal dist, log normal , chi square , possion dist , binomial , bernoullai\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  What is a discrete uniform distribution?\n",
        "    - in this type of diatribution the outcome are equally likely and the outcome are descrete and have the same probility the mean is a+b/2 and variance is n*n-1/12\n",
        "\n",
        "7.  What are the key properties of a Bernoulli distribution?\n",
        "    - two possible outcome 0 or 1, it has single parameter p (0 <p<1), mean is p , variance is p(1-p)\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  What is the binomial distribution, and how is it used in probability?\n",
        "    - binomial means two outcome , binomial means n bernoulai trail, its mean is np, variance is npq\n",
        "\n",
        "9.  What is the Poisson distribution and where is it applied?\n",
        "    - it is discrete probility distribution that describe the no of events that occur within fixed interval of time or space given\n",
        "    - no of event occured in a fixed time interval\n",
        "    - lamda is excepted no of events to occur at every time interval\n",
        "    - mean and variance is equal that is lambda*t\n",
        "\n",
        "10.  What is a continuous uniform distribution?\n",
        "     - it is distribution that has infinite no of values defined in a specified bound , random variable is continous\n",
        "\n",
        "11.  What are the characteristics of a normal distribution?\n",
        "     - it is a continous distribution\n",
        "     - it is symmetrical about mean\n",
        "     - mean = median = mode\n",
        "     - skewness = 0\n",
        "     - emprical rule of normal distribution :- 68%-95%-99.7% rule\n",
        "     - 68% of data of normal distribution lies within standard deviation from mean\n",
        "\n",
        "12.  What is the standard normal distribution, and why is it important?\n",
        "     - it is special case of normal distribution [sigma = 1, mue = 0] where sigma = standard deviation , mue = mean\n",
        "     \n",
        "13.  What is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), and why is it critical in statistics?\n",
        "- the clt states that if you have a population with a mean(mue) and standard deviation(sigma) and takes sufficiently large no of random sample from the population with replacement than the distribution of sample means will be approxmating normally distributed\n",
        "- the no of samples should be large\n",
        "- the smaple size should be greater than equal to 30\n",
        "\n",
        "14.  How does the Central Limit Theorem relate to the normal distribution?\n",
        "     - clt distribution will approxmately be a normal distribution(muue, sigma/sqtmue)\n",
        "     - The CLT explains why the normal distribution appears frequently — it's the limiting distribution of sums/averages of many random variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "15.  What is the application of Z statistics in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "     - Z-statistics are widely used in hypothesis testing when the population variance is known (or the sampla size is large enough that the sample standard deviation approximates it well)\n",
        "     - testing population mean\n",
        "     - testing difference between two mean\n",
        "\n",
        "16.  How do you calculate a Z-score, and what does it represent?\n",
        "     - it is calculated by (x-mue/sigma)\n",
        "     - lets take eg if score is 0.5 it states that x is 0.5sigma away from mean\n",
        "\n",
        "17.  What are point estimates and interval estimates in statistics?\n",
        "     - a point estimate is a single value that is used to estimate the true value of a poulation parameter\n",
        "     - interval estimate is used to estimate the unknown population parameter\n",
        "\n",
        "18.  What is the significance of confidence intervals in statistical analysis?\n",
        "     - Confidence intervals (CIs) are essential in statistical analysis because they provide a range of values for an unknown population parameter (like a mean or proportion) based on sample data — not just a single point estimate\n",
        "\n",
        "19.  What is the relationship between a Z-score and a confidence interval?\n",
        "     -  the Z-score is used to construct the confidence interval when the population standard deviation is known or the sample size is large.\n",
        "\n",
        "20.  How are Z-scores used to compare different distributions?\n",
        "     - Z-scores are used to compare values from different distributions by\n",
        "       transforming them into a common scale — the standard normal distribution. This allows you to determine how extreme or how typical each value is relative to its own distribution, and then make direct comparisons across different contexts.\n",
        "\n",
        "21.  What are the assumptions for applying the Central Limit Theorem?\n",
        "     - independent observation, finite mean and variance, large sample size\n",
        "\n",
        "22.  What is the concept of expected value in a probability distribution?\n",
        "     - The expected value (also called mean or expectation) of a probability distribution represents the long-run average outcome of a random variable if an experiment is repeated many times\n",
        "\n",
        "23.   How does a probability distribution relate to the expected outcome of a random variable?\n",
        "- A probability distribution directly determines the expected outcome (or expected value) of a random variable — it's the foundation for calculating what you expect to happen on average over many repetitions of a random process"
